Your Name: Emily Castillo


1. In your own words, please describe object-oriented programming and explain why it is useful.
OOP is a paradigm that structures a program into functions, classes, methods, and objects. Using 
OOP makes the program readable, easy to understand, and organized. Also, it makes the code reusable
and has easy access for modifications. OOP allows communication between classes and objects by 
inheritance and polymorphism.


2. Of all the different data structures we discussed, which one do you think is the "coolest" and why?
I think List Manipulation is the coolest because it is the most common data structure I have been using in 
Python classes. The methods allow working with lists in many different ways. Learning about lists 
manipulation was helpful. Also, because some of the list built-in methods are used in arrays.  


3. What is the most interesting thing you learned this semester?
The most interesting thing I learned this semester was inheritance. It made it easier to write code, 
and it made it work by reusing variables and data. It is maintenable and reduces a lot of repetition.


4. If this course included three more weeks, what additional topic(s) would you like to learn about?
I would like to learn about using more libraries. Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib were very useful. I 
wonder what other libraries would be helpful to know.


5. What was the biggest misconception you had about this material prior to this semester?
Before taking this class, I thought it was going to be very difficult, and I would have to learn a lot of abstract 
programming that I would not understand. Nevertheless, learning OOP has been very helpful. I can see myself working 
in the future with this paradigm.


6. Do you have any final questions/comments for your instructor?
Thanks for the teachings from this semester!
